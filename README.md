My solutions to CodeWars katas in Python.
Focus on clean code, readability, and algorithmic thinking.

How to improve Codewars-repository
1. Solve 6–5 kyu, not only 8–7 
2. Add O-notation
   - Time complexity: O(n)
   - Space complexity: O(1)
3. Add
   - naive solution
   - optimal solution
4. Add test coverage (using pytest)
